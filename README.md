# Trafalgar-website
Another practise website

Direct link: https://trafalgar-practice.netlify.app/

Created a small landing page for practicing html and css, and also added a little more javascript than was in the previous project.
Did not use third-party libraries, only pure js.

Tech stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
